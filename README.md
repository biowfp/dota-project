## About
____
The goal of the project is to allow DOTA 2 players to get stats and analysis of performance for their favourite teams and players without needing to collect and work with the data themselves. Right now itâ€™s really easy to access the data and not at all (for average people) - to see what that data means.

## Usage
____
Clone the repository, cd into the directory and run an opendota.py.

`cd ...\dota-project`

`python opendota.py`

To change the player or minimal patch (programm requests data up to current patch for now) go to the bottom of the file and find a row:
```python
player = PlayerData("mind_control", "7.22")
```
Input your desired player (make sure you spell nickname correctly) and minimal patch then run the file.
